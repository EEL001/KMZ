## Introduction
The King Maximum Zero (KMZ) Theory is a novel theoretical framework for understanding dynamic processes at both atomic and cosmic scales. This repository contains the core principles, mathematical frameworks, and potential applications of KMZ theory.

## Core Principles
1. **Maximum Zero (MZ)**: Represents the ultimate equilibrium point where positive and negative contributions cancel out.
2. **Dual Toroidal Fields**: Two toroidal fields representing the positive radiational (electro pulse) and negative magnetic (magnetic snapback) forces.
3. **KMZ-E (Electro Pulse Radiation)**: Represents the positive radiational forces, measured in hertz (Hz).
4. **KMZ-M (Magnetic Snapback)**: Represents the negative magnetic forces, measured in anti-hertz (Ahz).

## Mathematical Framework

### Equilibrium Equation
\[ 0 = E_{rad} + (-B_{mag}) \]

### Energy Generation (Fusion)
\[ E_{fusion} = \Delta m \cdot k_{base61} \]

### Magnetic Field Strength
\[ B_{mag} = \frac{\Phi}{A} \]

### Radiational Force
\[ F_{rad} = \frac{E_{fusion}}{r} \]

### Magnetic Force
\[ F_{mag} = B_{mag} \cdot I \cdot L \]

### Resonance Frequency
\[ f_{res} = \frac{1}{2\pi} \sqrt{\frac{E_{fusion}}{m}} \]

### Electromagnetic Flow
\[ EM_{flow} = F_{rad} - F_{mag} \]

## Visualization and Applications
Visualizations of harmonic interactions, interference patterns, and other KMZ principles can be created using Python scripts included in this repository.

## Usage
To set up the environment and run the scripts, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/KMZ.git
   cd KMZ
